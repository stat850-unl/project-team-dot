## Introduction

This dataset contains information about the fiction bestseller list of The New York Times between the years 1931 to 2020. This dataset includes the title, author(s), publication date, rank, and other information for every work recorded since the list's founding in 1931 but We are considering data from 2000 to 2020 and we would like to look into the relationship among different variables

## Five number summeries

From NY Best seller book list we have created three box blots of 3 individual numeric variables that show some outliers in total_weeks and Best_rank variable

## Average Total Weeks per Year

The average total weeks was highest in 2004 and lowest in 2007. The number of average total weeks mostly increased by approximately 56% from 2002 to 2003 and decreased by 41% from 2005 to 2006.

## Total weeks distribution with outliers

This graph represents the distribution of the total number of weeks each book has spent on the bestseller list. Some outliers are also visible in this plot representing the book names which stayed more than 80 weeks in the data.

## Correlation Between Debut Rank and Total Weeks

Here the Correlation Between Debut Rank and Total Weeks is -0.08535088 which is very weak and negatively correlated. So we can make the decision that books that debut at a higher rank don't necessarily tend to stay on the list longer. Actually no relation between debut rank and total weeks.

## Regression analysis and Coefficient box Plot

By analyzing this regression model, we have found that to secure the best rank on the New York Times best-seller list, staying on that list for more weeks has a significant impact. Coefficient box plot showing that debut_rank more substantial impact to secure best rank for a book.

## Best rank distribution for the top 10 authors in the list based on the number of appearances over the years

Danielle Steel has a higher variability but this can be due to the difference in the number of books of each author. We can say that some of the books of that author did extremely well. Also, John Grisham has most of his books in the top three.

## Shiny App

We have created a shiny graph to search the book according to the author. If anyone is interested to know the name of the author of any particular book, he/she will find this easily. This makes it easy for anyone to search the author and see which books that particular author wrote.

## Conclusion

-   The study revealed some intriguing details about a few books that made the best-seller list and for which the total weeks distribution graph was mostly rightly skewed.
-   Dr. Seuss and Dan Brown who are the authors of these 2 books are the top authors who appeared in the list for the most number of weeks during the years 2000-2020
-   There is a negative correlation between debut rank and total weeks, meaning that books with higher debut ranks don't necessarily stay on the best-seller list.
