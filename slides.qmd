## Correlation Between Debut Rank and Total Weeks

Here the Correlation Between Debut Rank and Total Weeks is -0.08535088 which is very weak and negatively correlated. So we can make the decision that books that debut at a higher rank don't necessarily tend to stay on the list longer. Actually no relation between debut rank and total weeks.

## Regression analysis and Coefficient box Plot

By analyzing this regression model, we have found that to secure the best rank on the New York Times best-seller list, staying on that list for more weeks has a significant impact. Coefficient box plot showing that debut_rank more substantial impact to secure best rank for a book.
