## Introduction

This dataset contains information about the fiction bestseller list of **The New York Times** between the years **1931 to 2020**. This dataset includes the title, author(s), publication date, rank, and other information for every work recorded since the list's founding in 1931.

Every row in the dataset represents a single "entry"---a single slot for a particular week---on the list. There are usually ten or fifteen works listed each week. But the number of bestsellers the Times features in a given week varies, so there may be 3, 6, 7, 8, or 16.

It was collected from the **Tidy Tuesday Archive**. The source link is- https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-05-10/readme.md#nyt_titlestsv

There are 8 variables in nyt_titles and 6 variables in nyt_full. Here is a data dictionary showing each variable, the type of variable, units, and range of values that are possible:

nyt_full.tsv:

-    year - the year of appearance 

-   week - the weekly issue of the bestseller list 

-   rank - the book's rank on the list for that week 

-   title_id - a unique ID mapping titles to the nyt_titles spreadsheet 

-   title - title of the novel, as reported by the New York Times 

-   author - author of the novel, as reported by the New York Times

nyt_titles.tsv:

-   id - an arbitrary unique id for the novel

-    title - the title of the novel, as reported by the New York Times

-    author - the author of the novel, as reported by the New York Times 

-   year - the first year that the novel appears on the bestseller list. 

-   total_weeks - the total number of weeks the title was on the list 

-   first_week - the first week that the novel appears on the bestseller list 

-   debut_rank - the book's bestseller rank in the week of its first appearance

-   best_rank - the highest rank achieved by the title while on the list

The above dataset will be used to explore different topics that will help book lovers to find out which authors have occasionally stayed on top of the best sellers list based on the total number of weeks or how many times they appeared on the list. We are considering data from 2000 to 2020, and we would like to look into the relationship between the debut rank and the total number of weeks a book has been on the list. In the meantime, we want to show the distribution of variables (year, total_week,debut_rank) in terms of bestsellers and a shiny app to find books by their author name. 

We have two variables in our dataset which are the debut rank and best rank , but there were some anomalies where the best rank for some books was a value greater than the debut rank , maybe this was due to some incorrect data entries so we removed those records as a data cleaning process.

**Objectives of this whole analysis:**

-   Average Total Weeks on Bestseller List per Year

-   Distribution of variables (total_weeks, debut_rank)

-   Top 10 books and authors in the bestseller list for the most number of weeks

-   Highest number of weeks a book appeared in the list in each year 

-   Relationship between the Debut Rank of a book and the Total Number of weeks in the list

-   Top 10 authors in the list based on the number of appearances over the years

-   Debut rank distribution for the top 10 authors in the list based on the number of appearances over the years

-   Best rank distribution for the top 10 authors in the list based on the number of appearances over the years

-   Checking significant relationships of best_rank variable with total_weeks and debut_rank 

## Methods

> As there are 2 datasets, nyt_titles and nyt_full we combined the 2 datasets and obtained a single dataframe. We used the `left_join` function from [@dplyr-package] `dplyr` package and combined 2 datasets using the title_id. As we are only interested in bestseller books from 2000 to 2020, we filtered the records from 2000 to 2020 from the combined dataset using the `filter` function.

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Get the Data

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-05-10')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2022, week = 19)

nyt_titles <- tuesdata$nyt_titles

# Or read in the data manually

nyt_titles <- readr::read_tsv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-05-10/nyt_titles.tsv')
nyt_full <- readr::read_tsv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-05-10/nyt_full.tsv')

library(dplyr)

#Combine the two dataframes
result <- nyt_full %>%
  left_join(select(nyt_titles,-year,-author,-title), by = c("title_id" = "id"))

# Filter rows with years from 2000 to 2020
filtered_data <- result %>%
  filter(year >= 2000&year<=2020)

```

> We created a new variable and added a new column called rank_difference by subtracting the best_rank from debut_rank. This is because there were some records where there were some errors in these two columns, therefore we only kept the rows where the best rank was a value less than or equal to the debut rank. We used the `filter` function from [@dplyr-package] `dplyr` package to do this. We used this dataset (filtered_final) to do some of our analysis. Since we wanted to check the correlation and fit a regression model we used this filtered dataset to explore our objectives.

```{r}
#| echo: false

#keeping only the records where the best rank is less than or equal to debut rank
filtered_final <- filtered_data %>%
  filter(best_rank <=debut_rank)

#creating the new column rank_difference
filtered_final <- filtered_final %>%
  mutate(rank_difference = debut_rank - best_rank)

```

> There were many records for one book title and due to that we were not able to obtain meaningful results and clear visual representations. Another topic we wanted to explore was comparing the variables best_rank, debut_rank and total_weeks. But these variables do not depend on the week the book appeared on the list, it only depends on the title id of the book. Therefore to get a more clear idea we filtered the dataset by keeping only the distinct title ids and carried out the rest of the analysis using this dataset.We used the `filter` function from [@dplyr-package] `dplyr` package to do this.Our filtered_final dataset contains 13164 observations and 11 variables. And the dataset we obtained after getting only the unique title id's had 2276 observations and 11 variables.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Keep only one row per book
final_data <- filtered_final %>%
  distinct(title_id, .keep_all=TRUE)

```

## Line plot of the average total_weeks per year

#| echo: false


# Calculate the average total_weeks per year

       x = "Year",
       y = "Average Total Weeks") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

***Topic:*** We tried to see on average which year has most of the Total Weeks on the Best Seller List. The @Avg_Total_Weeks_per_year line plot shows that the average total weeks was highest in 2004 and lowest in 2007 although the average was the same for 2011 and 2012. The number of average total weeks mostly increased by approximately 56% from 2002 to 2003 and decreased by 41% from 2005 to 2006. The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

### Debut Rank Distribution

       x = "Debut Rank",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(filtered_final$debut_rank), by = 2))

```

### Total week distribution plot

```{r fig-3}
#| label: Total_Weeks
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4 # Change the figure dimensions using fig-width/height
#| out-width: 80% # This changes the size of the figure as rendered in the text. 
#| fig-cap: "This figure shows the Distribution of Total Weeks on Best Seller List in fig-3. I've used geom_density to show the distribution and geomv_line to indicate the mean value in this plot. The figure is drawn with `ggplot2` [@ggplot2-package]."
#| echo: false

#Distribution of Total Weeks on Best Seller List
max_weeks <- max(filtered_final$total_weeks, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot(filtered_final, aes(x = total_weeks)) +
  geom_density(fill = "red", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(total_weeks)), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Total Weeks on Best Seller List",
       x = "Total Weeks",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max_weeks, by = 10))


```

***Distribution of some variables:***

Here we have shown @Distribution_of_Debut_Rank and @Total_Weeks on the Best seller list. For debut rank, the mean and median value is very close 9.184 and 9 respectively but this deviated a lot for total weeks which is 18.75 and 8 respectively. This result was reflected perfectly in both distribution plots.

From the plot, we can see Debut Rank distribution graph is approx bell shape but the Total Weeks graph has a long tail on the right or we can say it right skewed. In the total weeks density graph, we have also observed some outliers data which are approx 100 to 170 weeks. That means very few books actually stayed on the list for 100 to 170 weeks whereas most of the books stayed around 8 to 20 weeks.

### Correlation Between Debut Rank and Total Weeks

```{r fig-4}
#| label: Correlation_Between_Debut_Rank_and_Total_Weeks
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4 # Change the figure dimensions using fig-width/height
#| out-width: 80% # This changes the size of the figure as rendered in the text. 
#| fig-cap: "This figure shows the relationship between Debut Rank and Total Weeks in fig-4. I've used geom_point to show that total weeks point with corresponding debut rank. The figure is drawn with `ggplot2` [@ggplot2-package]."
#| echo: false

# Calculate the correlation between Total Weeks and Debut Rank
correlation_value <- cor(filtered_final$total_weeks, filtered_final$debut_rank)

# Print the correlation value
cat("Correlation between Total Weeks and Debut Rank:", correlation_value, "\n")

library(ggplot2)

# Calculate the correlation between Debut Rank and Total Weeks
correlation_value <- cor(filtered_final$debut_rank, filtered_final$total_weeks)

# Print the correlation value
cat("Correlation between Debut Rank and Total Weeks:", correlation_value, "\n")

# Plot a scatter plot
ggplot(filtered_final, aes(x = debut_rank, y = total_weeks)) +
  geom_point(color = "skyblue", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Debut Rank and Total Weeks",
       x = "Debut Rank",
       y = "Total Weeks on List") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Correlation: @Correlation_Between_Debut_Rank_and_Total_Weeks is: -0.08535088 which is very weak and negatively correlated. So we can make the decision that books that debut at a higher rank don't necessarily tend to stay on the list longer. Actually no relation between debut rank and total weeks

### Regression analysis and Coefficient box Plot

```{r fig-5 }
#| label: Coefficient_box_Plot
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4 # Change the figure dimensions using fig-width/height
#| out-width: 80% # This changes the size of the figure as rendered in the text. 
#| fig-cap: "This figure shows the coeffecient box plot from the regression model in fig-5. I've used geom_bar and geom_error bar. The figure is drawn with `ggplot2` [@ggplot2-package]."
#| echo: false

# Print the summary of the regression model
summary(regression_model)

library(car)

# Print the VIF values

# Extract coefficients and standard errors

se <- summary(regression_model)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"]

# Create a data frame for plotting
bar_data <- data.frame(
  Coefficient = names(coefficients),
  Estimate = coefficients,
  Std.Error = se
)

# Plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(bar_data, aes(x = Coefficient, y = Estimate, ymin = Estimate - 1.96 * Std.Error, ymax = Estimate + 1.96 * Std.Error)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  geom_errorbar(width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  labs(title = "Coefficient Plot",
       y = "Estimate",
       x = "Coefficient") +
  theme_minimal()

```

***Regression:*** Overall, the model seems to suggest that both total_weeks and debut_rank are significant predictors of best_rank. However, it's important to note that the low R-squared value indicates that there is still a large amount of unexplained variance, and the relationship between the predictors (total_weeks and debut_rank) and best_rank may be partially captured by the linear model.

By analyzing this regression model, we have found that to secure the best rank on the New York Times best-seller list, staying on that list for more weeks has a significant impact, and also same effect goes for debut rank as well.

**Checking Multicollinearity:** As both VIF value \<5, there is no multicollinearity on the predictor variable (total week and debut rank)

Next we wanted to explore the variables best_rank, debut_rank and total_weeks. As these variables do not depend on the week,the book appeared on the list,  we filtered the dataset by keeping only the distinct title ids and carried out the rest of the analysis using this dataset.

### Top **10 books and authors in the bestseller list for the most number of weeks**

# Adding a legend for titles
plot + guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Books"))

```

According to this figure @Top_10_books_for_most_no_of_weeks we can see that the book "Oh, the places you will go!" is the book that appeared in the bestseller list for the most number of weeks. This book appeared in the list for 178 weeks. The book "The Da Vinci Code" is also among the top books having appeared in the list for 165 weeks. The books "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone", "Gone girl" and "The girl who kicked the hornet's nest" were in the bestseller list for almost a similar number of weeks.

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))


```

In this figure @Top_10_authors_for_most_no_of_weeks we can see that, Dr. Seuss and Dan Brown who are the authors of the books "Oh, the places you will go!" and "The Da Vinci Code" are the top authors who appeared in the list for the most number of weeks. 

### **Highest number of weeks a book appeared in the list in each year**

```{r fig-8}

)

```

From this figure @Highest_no_of_weeks_for_each_year we can see that in the year 2000, the book  "Oh, the places you will go!" was in the list for  178 weeks and this drastically dropped to 35 weeks in 2001. Again this increased to 165 weeks in 2003 with the book ""The Da Vinci Code". The lowest number of weeks a book appeared was 24 weeks and it was in 2005 and that book was "The mermaid chair". We can observe that in some years a book appeared in the list for a very long period of time whereas in some years books were in the list for a short time. 

### Relationship between Debut Rank of a book and the Total Number of weeks in the list

```{r fig-9}
#| label: fig-debut-rank-vs-Tot-weeks
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4 # Change the figure dimensions using fig-width/height
#| out-width: 80% # This changes the size of the figure as rendered in the text. 
#| fig-cap: "This figure shows the jitter plot between the debut rank and the total number of weeks it was on the list. We have plotted a graph for each year by using year as the color. This plot was drawn from geom_jitter in the `ggplot2` [@ggplot2-package]."
#| echo: false


library(ggplot2)
# Jitter plot with color representing years and separate plots for each year
ggplot(final_data, aes(x = debut_rank, y = total_weeks, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Jitter Plot: Debut Rank vs Total Weeks on the List",
       x = "Debut Rank",
       y = "Total Weeks on the List",
       color = "Year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~ year, scales = "free")


```


According to @fig-debut-rank-vs-Tot-weeks we can see that the relationship between the two variables is not that strong. In the year 2005 we can see that books with a good debut rank have lasted for a longer time but this is not the case for the other years.


### Top 10 authors in the list based on the number of appearances over the years

```{r fig-10}
#| label: fig-top-ten-based-on-num-of-appearence
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4 # Change the figure dimensions using fig-width/height
#| out-width: 80% # This changes the size of the figure as rendered in the text. 
#| fig-cap: "This figure shows a word cloud for the top ten authors who appeared in the list for the most number of times. We grouped the cleaned dataset by the author and counted the number of times they appeared on the list. Then we got the top ten authors and created a word cloud to visualise this.Here the size of the word represents the amount of times they appeared on the list.This plot was drawn from wordcloud in the `wordcloud` [@wordcloud-package]. "
#| echo: false
library(wordcloud)

# Group by author and count the occurrences
author_appearances <- final_data %>%
  group_by(author) %>%
  summarise(appearances = n())

# Get the top ten authors with the highest number of appearances
top_ten_authors <- author_appearances %>%
  top_n(10, appearances)

# Create a color palette for each author
author_colors <- rainbow(length(top_ten_authors$author))

# Word Cloud with Different Colors for Each Author
wordcloud(words = top_ten_authors$author, freq = top_ten_authors$appearances, scale = c(3, 0.5), colors = author_colors)


```


When comparing this @fig-top-ten-based-on-num-of-appearence to the @Top_10_books_for_most_no_of_weeks that we drew , we can see that the authors who were considered as the top ten based on the total number weeks on the list and the number of times they appeared on the list is different. Hence, we can say that the authors who stay on the list for a long time are consistently popular, while those who appear frequently might become popular quickly, even if it's not for a long time. This shows that successful authors have different ways of being popular.

Using this @fig-debut-rank-distribution-for-above-top-ten we can say that all of these authors did not get a a rank below five when their book first appeared on the list. Most of the books have ranked between 6 and 12 for most of them. 


### Best rank distribution for the top 10 authors in the list based on the number of appearances over the years

##Best rank distribution for the top ten authors based on the appearences in the list
ggplot(final_data %>% filter(author %in% top_ten_authors$author), aes(x = author, y = best_rank, color = author)) +

```


In this @fig-best-rank-distribution-for-above-top-ten  figure, we can see that Danielle Steel has a higher variability but this can be due to the difference in the number of books of each author. We can say that some of the books of that order did extremely well. Also, Janet Evanovich and John Grisham have most of the best ranks in the top five.













You can find additional information about formatting figures generated from code in the [quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#computations).

## Additional Exploration topic

##Shiny App: We have created a shiny graph to search the book according to the author. If anyone is interested to know the name of the author of any particular book, he/she will find this easily. This makes easy for anyone to search the author and see which books that particular author wrote.

Add another topic here... as many as you desire, really. Make sure to include a transition between the two sections that connects the two with some sort of logical train of thought.

## Conclusion

Here, you want to summarize the main points of what you've learned from this investigation, in paragraph form.

## Tips

(delete this section from your report!)

Almost anything you might want to know about how to format output in quarto can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). Feel free to email/come to office hours to figure out how to do XYZ - part of the goal of making you write this report is that I want you to know how to write e.g. a journal paper in Quarto as well, so now's the time to experiment.

If you want to know what the wordcount of your report is, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```         
pandoc --lua-filter wordcount.lua report.qmd
```

Notice that I have not pushed `_output/report.html` or the `_output/report_files/` folder to github - this is intentional. I have actually set `_output` to not show up in git, to encourage you all to NOT push the rendered files to github and to instead work from the markdown files directly.

You may find it cleaner to create a figure subdirectory and store any figures that aren't created by R/Python in that folder. I encourage you to organize this repository in a sensible way.
