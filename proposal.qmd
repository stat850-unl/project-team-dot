## Instructions

Each member of your team should modify this document in some way and push their modifications to the repository in a separate commit. This will ensure that you have set your repository up in a way that ensures all group members are working with the same repository.

Please ensure that you have set your git name and email address on your computer by **modifying** the following commands and running them in the terminal:

```         
git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config --global user.email "mona@lisa.com"
```

In the proposal as in the final report, all of your code chunks should be set so that `echo = F`, which prevents the code from being printed in the report. You should also set `message = F, warning = F`, which will reduce the amount of additional output which is present in the report. You can customize the execution of code in quarto by using additional options, some of which are detailed [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).

### Source

```{r}

# Get the Data

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-05-10')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2022, week = 19)

nyt_titles <- tuesdata$nyt_titles

# Or read in the data manually

nyt_titles <- readr::read_tsv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-05-10/nyt_titles.tsv')

```

### Description

This dataset contains information about the fiction bestseller list of ***The New York Times*** between the years **1931 to 2020**. This dataset includes the title, author(s), publication date, rank, and other information for every work recorded since the list's founding in 1931.

Every row in the dataset represents a single *"entry"*---that is, a single slot for a particular week---on the list. There will usually be ten or fifteen works listed each week. But the number of bestsellers the Times features in a given week varies, so there may be 3, 6, 7, 8, or 16.

It was collected from ***Tidy Tuesday Archive***. The source link is- https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-05-10/readme.md#nyt_titlestsv

There are 8 variables in nyt_titles and 6 variables in nyt_full. Here is a data dictionary showing each variable, the type of variable, units, and range of values that are possible:

# `nyt_titles`

Can we change the project goals when we start doing the analysis?

The division of labor may change once we start doing the project according to the tasks.
